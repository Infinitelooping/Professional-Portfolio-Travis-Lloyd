# Professional-Portfolio-Travis-Lloyd

## Work to be added
Added filler "google.com" links for unused portfolio windows where future projects and work will go.
Links are still active and "coming soon" background-images have been put in place.

## Media-Queries
We have implemented screen viewpoints for the 765px range.

## Pages vs default browser
Note: I have been working off the view from my default browser, and the scaling of everything was founf to be different on the deployed site from pages. Will need to rearrange.

## Links for contact
added lings to contact me including phone number, and email that will automatically pull up phone options and email options when clicked.
